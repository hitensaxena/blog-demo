          <!-- Introduction -->
          <p class="fade-section">
            Every life event — falling in love, losing a job, chasing a high — once
            felt like an unbroken timeline of “me.” Then, that illusion shattered.
            For a fleeting, crystalline moment I slipped behind the curtain and
            discovered something startling: reality unfolds in episodes, each
            expertly scripted by Māyā, and none of them are who I am. It was as
            though someone had paused a film, pulled me into the projection
            booth, and whispered, “See? You’re not the character, you’re the
            light.”
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">Returning to the Ship</h2>
          <p class="fade-section">
            The shift was visceral. Bliss rushed in the way sea air floods your lungs
            when you finally step back aboard your ship after a long adventure.
            But it wasn’t my apartment that felt familiar; it was a silent
            vantage point that had always watched. From there, every immersive
            chapter of my life looked like a voyage: intense, instructive, but
            ultimately temporary — like fleeting waypoints on an endless
            horizon. I realised that I hadn’t truly gone anywhere. The traveller,
            the road and the destination were woven from the same luminous
            fabric of awareness. Home was simply the recognition of that fabric —
            unchanging, ever‑present.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">The Tyranny of Labels</h2>
          <p class="fade-section">
            What keeps me glued to each chapter are the labels I slap on
            experience: “Girlfriend.” I still taste the carbonara we shared the
            night that label slipped from my lips; her name vanished, and a role
            took its place. “Career.” One promotion later, the horizon shrank into
            a glass‑walled corridor I called purpose.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Labels shrink the boundless into neat, name‑tagged boxes, breeding
            distance where intimacy could be. The mind loves them because
            labels promise predictability, but they charge a toll: they dull the
            mystery. When the labels fade, so does the distance. Connection is
            the resonance that remains once names fall away. I noticed a
            curious law: the more words I stack between myself and
            something, the fainter its living pulse becomes. A forest reduced to
            “timber,” a human reduced to “resource,” a breath reduced to
            “oxygen exchange.” Each label is a pixel of separation — remove
            enough pixels and the image becomes whole again.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">Māyā as Background Noise</h2>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Imagine a diffusion model in AI: an image begins as random static,
            then iteratively clarifies. Māyā works, perversely, in reverse. It adds
            conceptual noise until pure awareness blurs into a personal story
            packed with protagonists, antagonists and sub‑plots. Spiritual
            practice, therefore, is nothing more than iterative denoising — a daily
            polish of the inner lens of awareness.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Seen this way, setbacks are not regressions but fresh “noise
            injections,” letting me test the fidelity of my clarity. The game, then,
            is not to avoid noise but to recognise it faster and polish the lens
            sooner.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">Simple Experiments</h2>
          <div class="callout fade-section">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sound → Vibration</strong> — Repeat any word until it melts into
              syllables. Meaning evaporates; only texture and rhythm remain.
              Listen for the moment a noun turns into music.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vision → Form</strong> — Gaze at an object without naming it. Let
              colours, edges and textures stand free of “cup” or “tree.” Notice
              how the world brightens without commentary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Thought → Origin</strong> — When mental chatter surges, ask,
              “Who is aware?” and linger in the pause that follows. That pause
              is home base, the only platform that doesn’t move.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 class="fade-section">A Cyclic Map</h2>
          <div class="callout fade-section">
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Immersion</strong> — Māyā’s tunnel vision tightens; the story feels
              absolute.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Insight</strong> — A crack; the tunnel widens, light pours in, context
              returns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integration</strong> — Lessons logged, behaviours tuned,
              gratitude recorded. The journey resumes — but each loop
              shortens the stay in illusion.
            </li>
          </ol>
          </div>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Round after round, the pendulum swings with less amplitude.
            Eventually the motion may still, but even the sway is beautiful once
            you know you’re not the clock.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">What Remains</h2>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Intellect can chart the terrain, but only direct perception walks it.
            Every insight, no matter how luminous, is provisional until it
            dissolves in the next layer of Māyā. Yet something survives each
            dissolution: the witnessing awareness itself — a sky that never frets
            over passing clouds.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Not this label, not that episode — only the seeing that sees them
            come and go.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Hold that thread; follow it home. And when Māyā paints a new
            scene, smile: the screen is brighter for being cleaned so often.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">Base Reality — The Ground Beneath All Episodes</h2>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Beyond every voyage and every veil lies a still, self‑luminous field
            of knowing. I call it Base Reality — the unconditioned witness that
            remains present before, during and after each adventure. It cannot
            be improved, escaped or defined; it can only be recognised.
            When a moment of silence opens and all narratives pause, the
            subtle hum you sense underneath experience is this Base Reality.
            Practices don’t create it; they only remove what obscures it.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            <strong>A pointer:</strong> Notice the micro‑gap between an exhale ending
            and the next inhale beginning. Awareness is already there,
            needing nothing.
          </p>

          <h2 class="fade-section">Labels, Systems, and the Double‑Edged Sword of Order</h2>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Labels do more than imprison perception; they also organise
            reality into workable systems. Language, science, economies — each
            is a lattice of agreed‑upon labels that allow millions of strangers to
            cooperate. A highway sign, a medical chart, a line of code: without
            the efficiency of labelling, civilisation stalls.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Yet the same structure that enables coordination can fossilise
            into rigidity. The label “forest resource” powers industry; it also
            muffles birdsong. The trick is conscious deployment: use labels as
            tools, not truths. Map territory without mistaking the map for
            the ground.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            Systems gain strength when labels stay fluid; consciousness gains
            freedom when it remembers the unlabeled ground.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-section">
            <strong>Practical inquiry:</strong> Next time you design, write or plan, ask,
            “Which labels serve clarity, and which merely soothe my need for
            control?” Swap the latter for fresh eyes and see what new
            pathways open.
